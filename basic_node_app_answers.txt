>What is a Node module?

A node module is a set of functions that you can include in your application. You can use built in modules and or create your own custom modules.

>What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

module.exports is the object returned from the require function. "exports" is a reference to module.exports. When using "exports", it is never returned, it is only a reference to module.exports. 

>Why is using exports recommended?

Unless you are creating a module that is a specific object type, you can skip module.exports and use exports.
